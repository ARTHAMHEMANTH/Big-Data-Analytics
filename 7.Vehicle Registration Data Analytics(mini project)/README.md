# Project:  7.Real-time Vehicle Registration Data Analytics

## 📊 Project Overview
Comprehensive analysis of vehicle registration data across India, examining trends, patterns, and insights from 2007-08 to 2020-21.

## 🎯 Analysis Objectives


### Dataset Overview
- Analyze vehicle registration data with 1,000 records across 8 features
- Examine comprehensive dataset structure and characteristics

### Data Quality Assessment
- Perform missing value analysis and validation
- Conduct duplicate detection and removal
- Ensure data integrity and consistency

### Statistical Analysis
- Generate comprehensive numerical summaries
- Analyze distributions and central tendencies
- Identify outliers and data patterns

### Multi-dimensional Analysis
- **Category-wise**: Explore vehicle types (Passenger Cars, Utility Vehicles, Two Wheelers, etc.)
- **Regional**: Examine geographic distribution across 5 regions (North, South, East, West, Central)
- **Fuel Type**: Analyze adoption patterns of 7 fuel types including Electric, Hybrid, CNG
- **Ownership**: Study distribution across Private, Commercial, Government, and Export categories
- **Temporal**: Track registration trends from 2007-08 to 2020-21
- **Transmission**: Compare Manual vs Automatic transmission preferences

## 📈 Dataset Characteristics

### Basic Metrics
- **Total Records**: 1,000 entries
- **Time Span**: 14 financial years (2007-08 to 2020-21)
- **Geographic Coverage**: 5 regions with comprehensive national representation
- **Data Quality**: Zero missing values and no duplicate records

### Feature Diversity
- **Vehicle Categories**: 10 unique categories
- **Subcategories**: 21 specific vehicle types
- **Fuel Types**: 7 different fuel options
- **Transmission**: 2 types (Manual/Automatic)
- **Ownership**: 4 categories (Private, Commercial, Government, Export)
